# AspectOnly

This project aims to demonstrate a Java application without any non-trivial code inside methods. The only code in the application will be advice inside aspects (AspectJ).

Do not try this at home. This is an extreme example of Aspect-Oriented Programming and is not indicative of good programming practices.
